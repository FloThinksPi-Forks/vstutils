Application loading on frontend
================================
Loading of VST Utils application on client is done by **app-loader.js** script.

Application loading steps
-------------------------
To load application **app-loader.js** is going through following steps:

    1. loading of app's dependencies (via :ref:`app-dependencies-loader-class`):

        * OpenAPI schema;
        * static files (JS, CSS, TPl);
    2. creating of app instance (:ref:`app-class`) and saving it to the global 'app' variable;
    3. invoking of :ref:`app.start() <app-class-start-method>` method.
       This method initiates :doc:`parsing of OpenAPI schema and generating of frontend Models and Views </openapi-schema-parsing>`
       and mounts root Vue instance to the DOM, after all :ref:`Models objects <model-class>` and :ref:`Views objects <view-class>` was generated.

Optimization of application loading
-----------------------------------
VST Utils tries to load your application as fast as possible,
that's why VST Utils uses Service Worker and IndexedDB during its work.

Service Worker is used for caching of:

* static files (CSS, JS, fonts, images);
* offline fallback page (offline.html).

Service worker is a great tool, that does all dirty things with caching for us,
but, unfortunately, it works only if application is working on the host with HTTPS.

We can't be enough sure, that all applications, based on VST Utils, will be always working under HTTPS,
that why we also use IndexedDB for caching the most heavy API requests.

IndexedDB is used for caching of:

* OpenAPI schema;
* list of available interface languages (interface localization);
* dicts with translations for different languages.

Service Worker and IndexedDB will store this cache while application version is staying the same.
Once application version changed, Service Worker and IndexedBD caches will automatically clean
and application will load new OpenAPI schema, new static files and so on.
That's why the longest application loading will be, when user loads application of new version.
Each time user tries to load application of the same version as he loaded before,
application will be loading much faster, than at the first time,
because of using Service Worker and IndexedDB caches.
