Quick Start
===========
Starting of new project, based on VST Utils Framework, is rather simple. All you need to do is run several commands.

New application creation
------------------------

1. **Install VST Utils**

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        pip install vstutils

2. **Create new project, based on VST Utils**

    You can execute base command for new project creation.

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        python -m vstutils newproject --name {{app_name}}

    This command will confirm you such options of new app, as:

    * **project name** - name of your new application;
    * **project guiname** - name of your new application, that will be used in GUI (web-interface);
    * **project directory** - path to directory, where project will be created.

    Or you can execute following command, that includes all needed data for new project creation.

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        python -m vstutils newproject --name {{app_name}} --dir {{app_dir}} --guiname {{app_guiname}} --noinput

    This command creates new project without confirming any data.


    Both these commands create several files in ``project directory``,
    that was mentioned in the new project creation command.

    .. sourcecode:: yaml

       /{{app_dir}}/{{app_name}}/
                                /MANIFEST.in
                                /{{app_name}}/
                                /README.rst
                                /requirements-test.txt
                                /requirements.txt
                                /setup.cfg
                                /setup.py
                                /test.py
                                /tox.ini


    where:

    * **MANIFEST.in** - this file is used for building installation package;
    * **{{app_name}}** - directory with files of your application;
    * **README.rst** - default README file for your application (this file includes base commands for starting/stopping your application);
    * **requirements-test.txt** - file with list of requirements for test environment;
    * **requirements.txt** - file with list of requirements for your application;
    * **setup.cfg** - this file is used for building installation package;
    * **setup.py** - this file is used for building installation package;
    * **test.py** - this file is used for tests creation;
    * **tox.ini** - this file is used for tests execution.

    All following commands you should execute from the ``/{{app_dir}}/{{app_name}}/`` directory.

3. **Apply migrations**

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        python -m {{app_name}} migrate

4. **Create superuser**

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        python -m {{app_name}} createsuperuser

5. **Start your application**

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        python -m {{app_name}} web

    Web-interface of your application will be started on the port 8080.

    .. image:: img/app_example_login_page.png

    If you need to stop your application, use following command:

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        python -m {{app_name}} web stop=/tmp/{{app_name}}_web.pid


Current algorithm of new project Quick Start allows you to create the simplest application, based on VST Utils framework.
This application will contain only User Model. If you want to create your own models look following section.


Adding new models to application
--------------------------------
If you want to add some new entities to your application, you need to do following on the back-end:

 1. Create Model;
 2. Create Serializer;
 3. Create View;
 4. Add created View to the API;
 5. Make migrations;
 6. Apply migrations;
 7. Restart your application.

Let't look how you can do it on the AppExample - application, that has 2 custom models:

* Task (abstraction for some tasks/activities, that user should do);
* Stage (abstraction for some stages, that user should do to complete the task. This model is nested into the Task Model).


Models creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Firstly, you need to create file ``models.py`` in the ``/{{app_dir}}/{{app_name}}/{{app_name}}/`` directory.

Then you need to add some code like this to ``models.py``:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from django.db import models
    from vstutils.models import BModel


    class Stage(BModel):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=256)
        order = models.IntegerField(default=0)

        class Meta:
            default_related_name = "stage"
            ordering = ('order', 'id',)


    class Task(BModel):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=256)
        stages = models.ManyToManyField(Stage)


More information about Models you can find in `Django Models documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/models/>`_.


Serializers creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Firstly, you need to create file ``serializers.py`` in the ``/{{app_dir}}/{{app_name}}/{{app_name}}/`` directory.

Then you need to add some code like this to ``serializers.py``:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from vstutils.api import serializers as vst_serializers
    from . import models as models


    class StageSerializer(vst_serializers.VSTSerializer):

        class Meta:
            model = models.Stage
            fields = ('id',
                      'name',
                      'order',)


    class TaskSerializer(vst_serializers.VSTSerializer):

        class Meta:
            model = models.Task
            fields = ('id',
                      'name')


More information about Serializers you can find in `Django REST Framework documentation for Serializers <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/#modelserializer>`_.

Views creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Firstly, you need to create file ``views.py`` in the ``/{{app_dir}}/{{app_name}}/{{app_name}}/`` directory.

Then you need to add some code like this to ``views.py``:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from vstutils.api import decorators as deco
    from vstutils.api.base import ModelViewSet
    from . import serializers as sers


    class StageViewSet(ModelViewSet):
        model = sers.models.Stage
        # Serializer for list view (view for a list of Model instances
        serializer_class = sers.StageSerializer
        # Serializer for page view (view for one Model instance).
        # This property is not required, if its value is the same as `serializer_class`.
        serializer_class_one = sers.StageSerializer

    '''
    Decorator, that allows to put one view into another
        * 'stages' - Name of related QuerySet to the child model instances (we set it in Task model as "stages = models.ManyToManyField(Stage)")
        * 'id' - Name of field, that is used as unique identifier in child model
        * view - Nested view, that will be child view for decorated view
    '''
    @deco.nested_view('stages', 'id', view=StageViewSet)
    class TaskViewSet(ModelViewSet):
        model = sers.models.Task
        serializer_class = sers.TaskSerializer
        serializer_class_one = sers.TaskSerializer

More information about Views and ViewSets you can find in `Django REST Framework documentation for views <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/>`_.

Adding Models to API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To add created Models to the API you need to write something like this at the end of your ``settings.py`` file:

.. sourcecode:: python

    '''
    Some code generated by VST Utils
    '''

    '''
    Adds Task view set to the API
    Only 'root' (parent) views should be added there.
    Nested views will be added automatically, that's why we add there only Task view.
    Stage view will be added automatically, because it is nested to the Task view.
    '''
    API[VST_API_VERSION][r'task'] = {
        'view': 'newapp2.views.TaskViewSet'
    }

    # Adds link to the task view to the GUI menu
    PROJECT_GUI_MENU.insert(0, {
        'name': 'Task',
         # CSS class of font-awesome icon
        'span_class': 'fa fa-list-alt',
        'url': '/task'
    })


Migrations creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To make migrations you need to open ``/{{app_dir}}/{{app_name}}/`` directory and execute following command:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    python -m {{app_name}} makemigrations {{app_name}}

More information about Migrations you can find in `Django Migrations documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/migrations/>`_.


Migrations applying
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To apply migrations you need to open ``/{{app_dir}}/{{app_name}}/`` directory and execute following command:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    python -m {{app_name}} migrate


Restart of Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To restart your application, firstly, you need to stop it (if it was started before):

.. sourcecode:: bash

    python -m {{app_name}} web stop=/tmp/{{app_name}}_web.pid

And then start it again:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    python -m {{app_name}} web

After cache reloading you will see following page:

.. image:: img/app_example_home_page.png

As you can see, link to new Task View was added to the sidebar menu. Let't click on it.

.. image:: img/app_example_task_empty_list_page.png

As you can see, there is no task instance in your app. Let's click on 'new' button.

.. image:: img/app_example_new_task_page.png

After new task creation you will see following page:

.. image:: img/app_example_created_task_page.png

As you can see, there is 'stages' button, that opens page with this task's stages list. Let's click on it.

.. image:: img/app_example_stage_empty_list_page.png

As you can see, there is no stage instance in your app. Let's create 2 new stages.

.. image:: img/app_example_new_stage2_page.png
.. image:: img/app_example_new_stage1_page.png

After stages creation page with stages list will looks like this:

.. image:: img/app_example_stage_list_page.png

As you can see, sorting by 'order' field is working, as we mentioned in the our ``models.py`` file for Stage Model.
